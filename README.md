# About me

I'm a physiologist by academic training, my research interests include synaptic, behavioral and circuit level alteration in neurodegeneration like Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Alzheimer's is known to characterized by extracellular amyloid plaque and intracellular neurofibrillary tangle deposition in brain parenchyma. Which is implicated with patient's cognitive impairment and have direct association with synaptic dysfunction. My present role is to understand the role of genetic risk factors altering synaptic functions of AD (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01024-z).

I'm working with [Dr Christophe Mulle](https://iins.u-bordeaux.fr/MULLE#mem) in the team Synapses and Neural Circuits in Behaviour at IINS (UMR5297), Bordeaux Neurocampus. My PhD thesis investigated the role of non-invasive brain stimulation in animal model of AD. Thesis title: ‘‘A morphological and functional study on intracerebroventricular streptozotocin induced rat model of Alzheimer’s disease: Effect of magnetic field stimulation’’. This work was conducted in Neurophysiology and nano-medicine lab with [Dr Suman Jain](https://www.aiims.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=669&Itemid=1502&lang=en) in All India Institute for Medical Sciences, New Delhi.

- Bachelors in Science   Physiology   University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India (_August; 2013_)

# Work experiences
- In a short project supported by short term studentship and student fellowhip & skill development scheme by ICMR and DBT respectively I have looked into the potential to generate and incorporate new neurons in adult network of adult hippocampus of animals that has been exposed to extreemely low intensity and low frequency magnetic field _(sinusoidal, 17.96µT, 50Hz)_. In this project I've noit only learnt the mechanism of action of magnetic firld stimulation directly affecting the [cognition through manipulation of adult born circuitry](https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/52/Supplement_1/afac322.037/6987738?login=true), but also got chance to guide two briliant students.

- I've worked in a indiviual senior research fellowship program vide.45/5/2019-PHY/BMS from _Indian Council of Medical Sciences_ at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi from April 2019-2022 in project entittled as '“Effect of Chronic Exposure to Low Intensity Magnetic Field on Streptozotocin Induced Synaptic Dysfunction and Amyloid Precursor Protein Processing in Rats' where co-PIs were Dr Suman Jain & Dr Jyotirmoy Banerjee. The idea of the project was to investigate the [architechtural ateration](https://www.brainstimjrnl.com/article/S1935-861X(21)00379-X/fulltext) of the CA1 pyramidal layers of hippocampus injected with streptozotocin supported with the electrophysiological correlates of synaptic inputs with/ without sinusiodal magnetic field stimulation.   

- Currently from April 2022 till now I'm working to decipher the morpho-functional correlates of the genetic risk factors of Alzheimer's disease in a project with acronym _GENSYNALZ_ from **AAPG scheme from The French National Research Agency (ANR)**. This project is to develop tools to test the 
Alzheimer's risk genes in organotypic as well as acute slices to link morpho-functional relationship using transfection, microscopic and electrophysiological tools. Genes that we are targeting has been already funneled down with GWAS as well as priliminary through multi-electrode-aarray recordings on dissociated neuronal culture.

# Expertise
I work with acute slices from brains of animals transfected with AD risk genes. Therefore, I conduct single cell electroporation experiments, use viral tools for transfect neurons of choice. Recent electrophysiological experiments provide me to understand the intrinsic properties of granule cells of dentate gyrus (DG). And also to understand the dynamics of perforant pathway-DG synaptic circuitry. Apart from electrophysiology my other responsibilities includes morphological analysis of the DG cells both at dendritic as well as at spine level. To do so, I use multiple imaging platforms viz. wide-field, (epi)fluorescence and confocal microscopy. 

And then for analysis I use Igor pro, Neuromatic, open-ephy-python-tool for Ephys and FIJI, Imaris, NeuroStudio and others for imaging experiments.    

Previously, I used to do cognitive tasks with rodents. Also microinjection through stereotaxic surgeries in brain areas (like hippocampus, lateral ventricles, hypothalamus etc.). Also I did different histological tools (Nissl, Golgi-COX, Congo-red) including immunostaining for sub-cellular localisation of proteins, biochemicals tools (ELISA, western blot), 1H-NMR, transmission electron microscopy. 

During this period I came across different softwares related to the aforementioned tools like Ethovision XT, AnyMaze, FIJI, Neurolucida, Neurolucida-explorer, Mnova, TopSpin, Espina, webknoss, python, SPSS, graphpad etc.

# Journal role
Apart from doing experimental neuroscience I'm also involved in reviewing papers in peer review journals as ad-hoc reviewer in journals like 
**Neurochemical research**; 
**Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy**; 
**International journal of general Medicine**.
