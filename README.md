# About me

I'm a physiologist by academic training, my research interests include synaptic, behavioral and circuit level alteration in neurodegeneration like Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Alzheimer's is known to characterized by extracellular amyloid plaque and intracellular neurofibrillary tangle deposition in brain parenchyma. Which is implicated with patient's cognitive impairment and have direct association with synaptic dysfunction. My present role is to understand the role of genetic risk factors altering synaptic functions of AD (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01024-z).

I'm working with Dr Christophe Mulle in the team Synapses and Neural Circuits in Behaviour at IINS (UMR5297), Bordeaux Neurocampus. My PhD thesis investigated the role of non-invasive brain stimulation in animal model of AD. Thesis title: ‘‘A morphological and functional study on intracerebroventricular streptozotocin induced rat model of Alzheimer’s disease: Effect of magnetic field stimulation’’. This work was conducted in Neurophysiology and nano-medicine lab with Dr Suman Jain in All India Institute for Medical Sciences, New Delhi.


# Education

Bachelors in Science   Physiology   University of Calcutta (2013)

Masters in Science   Human Physiology   University of Calcutta (2015)

Doctor of Philosophy   Neurophysiology   All India Institute for Medical Sciences (2022)  


# Expertise
I work with acute slices from brains of animals transfected with AD risk genes. Therefore, I conduct single cell electroporation experiments, use viral tools for transfect neurons of choice. Recent electrophysiological experiments provide me to understand the intrinsic properties of granule cells of dentate gyrus (DG). And also to understand the dynamics of perforant pathway-DG synaptic circuitry. Apart from electrophysiology my other responsibilities includes morphological analysis of the DG cells both at dendritic as well as at spine level. To do so, I use multiple imaging platforms viz. wide-field, (epi)fluorescence and confocal microscopy. 

And then for analysis I use Igor pro, Neuromatic, open-ephy-python-tool for Ephys and FIJI, Imaris, NeuroStudio and others for imaging experiments.    

Previously, I used to do cognitive tasks with rodents. Also microinjection through stereotaxic surgeries in brain areas (like hippocampus, lateral ventricles, hypothalamus etc.). Also I did different histological tools (Nissl, Golgi-COX, Congo-red) including immunostaining for sub-cellular localisation of proteins, biochemicals tools (ELISA, western blot), 1H-NMR, transmission electron microscopy. 

During this period I came across different softwares related to the aforementioned tools like Ethovision XT, AnyMaze, FIJI, Neurolucida, Neurolucida-explorer, Mnova, TopSpin, Espina, webknoss, python, SPSS, graphpad etc.

# Journal role
Apart from doing experimental neuroscience I'm also involved in reviewing papers in peer review journals as ad-hoc reviewer in journals like Neurochemical research; Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy; International journal of general Medicine.
